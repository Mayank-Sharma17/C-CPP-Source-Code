Q1 : What is tokens in C ?

In C programming, tokens are the smallest individual units of a program that are meaningful to the compiler. They are the fundamental building blocks from which all C programs are constructed. Think of them like the words and punctuation marks that form sentences in a natural language; without them, the compiler cannot understand the program's structure or intent.

There are six main types of tokens in C:

Keywords: These are reserved words in C that have predefined meanings and cannot be used for any other purpose, such as variable names. Examples include int, if, while, for, return, void, etc.

Identifiers: These are names given by the programmer to various program elements like variables, functions, arrays, structures, etc. They must follow specific naming rules (e.g., start with a letter or underscore, contain letters, digits, or underscores). Examples include main, totalSum, myVariable.

Constants: These are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. They can be of various types: 
Integer constants: 10, 0x2A (hexadecimal), 021 (octal)
Floating-point constants: 3.14, 2.5f
Character constants: 'a', '\\n' (newline character)
String literals: "Hello, World!"

Operators: These are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables or constants). Examples include:
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Assignment operator: =

Special Symbols (Punctuators): These are symbols that have specific structural or organizational roles in the C language. Examples include:
Parentheses () (for function calls, expressions)
Curly braces {} (for code blocks)
Square brackets [] (for arrays)
Comma , (to separate items)
Semicolon ; (to terminate statements)
Hash # (for preprocessor directives)

Strings: These are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, representing text. While technically a type of constant (string literal), they are often treated as a distinct category due to their frequent use and specific handling. Example: "This is a string."


Q2 : why in latest c language or version the best practice is we write int main means the main function return the int value but if we just print a single thing we have to write return 0; in the end why we do this istead just write void main() so we don't have to return 0 in the end ?

🧠 1. What actually happens when your program runs

When you run a C program, it is executed by the operating system (OS).
After your program finishes, the OS expects your program to return a value — this value tells the OS whether the program ran successfully or not.

That’s why the C standard defines:

int main(void)


or

int main(int argc, char *argv[])


The int means:

“When I finish, I’ll give an integer back to the operating system.”

✅ 2. Why return 0; is written

In C:

return 0; → means successful execution

Any non-zero value (like return 1;) → means error or abnormal exit

So when you write:

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello");
    return 0;
}


you are politely telling the OS:

“I finished properly — no errors happened.”

It’s part of standard, portable, professional code.

💡 3. What if you don’t write return 0;?

In modern C standards (C99 and later), if you don’t explicitly write return 0;, the compiler automatically assumes it for main().
So this is valid and equivalent:

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello");
} 


✅ It will still return 0 implicitly.
So adding return 0; is just good habit, for clarity and portability.

🚫 4. Why not void main()?

While void main() may work on some compilers, it is not standard C.
The C standard (ISO C99 and later) only allows:

int main(void)
int main(int argc, char *argv[])


That’s it.

Using void main() can:

cause undefined behavior on some systems,

break portability,

confuse the OS because it expects an integer return value.

🔍 5. Summary
Version	Allowed main forms	Return rule
C89/C90	int main() or int main(int argc, char *argv[])	Must explicitly return 0
C99+	Same as above	return 0; auto-added if omitted
void main()	❌ Non-standard	Avoid using it
✅ In short:

Always use

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}


even if it seems unnecessary — because it’s standard, portable, and clearly communicates program success.
